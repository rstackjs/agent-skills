# Rspack Best Practices

Apply these rules when writing or reviewing Rspack projects.

## Configuration

- Use `rspack.config.ts` and `defineConfig`
- Define explicit `entry` values for multi-page applications.
- Keep one main config and branch by `process.env.NODE_ENV` only when needed.
- Keep rule conditions narrow and explicit (`test`, `include`, `exclude`, `resourceQuery`).
- Prefer built-in Rspack plugins/loaders over community JS alternatives when equivalent features exist.

## CLI

If `@rspack/cli` is installed:

- Use `rspack dev` for local development.
- Use `rspack build` for production build.
- Use `rspack preview` only for local production preview.

## Type checking

- Use `ts-checker-rspack-plugin` for integrated dev/build type checks.
- Or run `tsc --noEmit`/`vue-tsc --noEmit` as an explicit script step.

## CSS

Choose one strategy:

- Built-in CSS (`type: 'css' | 'css/auto' | 'css/module'`) for modern setups.
- `css-loader` + `CssExtractRspackPlugin` for webpack migration compatibility.
- `style-loader` for pure style-in-JS runtime injection scenarios.

Optional:

- Use `builtin:lightningcss-loader` when goals are syntax downgrade + vendor prefixing.
- Use `sass-loader`/`less-loader` for preprocessing Sass/Less files.
- Use `@tailwindcss/webpack` for Tailwind CSS integration.

## Bundle size optimization

- Prefer dynamic `import()` for non-critical code paths.
- Prefer lightweight libraries where possible.
- Keep `target` aligned with real compatibility requirements.

## Assets management

- Import source-managed assets from project source directories, not from `public`.
- Reference `public` files by absolute URL path.
- Prefer asset modules (`asset`, `asset/inline`, `asset/source`) over legacy `file-loader/url-loader/raw-loader`.

## Profiling

- Use Node CPU profiling (`--cpu-prof`) when JavaScript-side overhead is suspected.
- Use `RSPACK_PROFILE=OVERVIEW` and analyze trace output for compiler-phase bottlenecks.
- Replace known slow stacks first (`babel-loader`, PostCSS, terser) with Rspack built-ins when feasible.

## Security

- Do not publish `.map` files to public servers/CDNs when production source maps are enabled.
